This is an attempt by me to do the internship task. I was not able to successfully make it responsive, but I designed the desktop and tablet version.

I used SASS for css and VITE as a module bundler to make the development process faster. I had major problems in making the card responsive by changing the flex-direction. That's the reason I was not able to make it look good on mobiles. Hope you consider my efforts.
